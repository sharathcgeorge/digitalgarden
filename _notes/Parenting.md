I have a two year old daughter and found out that it's like having a second full time job that everyone brushes under the carpet. Not to mean everyone has been unsympathetic, but the slack you get from the world is less than you expect, given you're sleep deprived, confused and overwhelmed. 

At the hospital, you're handed this bundle that weighs a few kilograms of the most complicated organic machinery, and then they send you home without a manual. It's like everyone in the world has done this before, so you are automatically supposed to know how it works. And yes, you do figure out most of it, but after a lot more pain than should be necessary.

Here are some things that helped us

* Parenting books
	* The only one I read and recommend is Brain Rules for Baby: How to Raise a Smart and Happy Child from Zero to Five by Dr. John Medina. It's written by a scientist and offers **only advice that is scientifically verified**. He clearly calls out the level of certainty or uncertainty about each tip and the most important benefit of the book is that it tells you what not to waste your money and effort on
* Tips on handling sleep deprivation
	* Accept you won't get uninterrupted sleep for a year at least, unless you enjoy the fruits of patriarchy
	* Try to do something fun when you're up at 3 am rocking a baby. I read the entire stormlight archives book series on my kindle during this phase, and also played online chess with a few other new parents. The turn by turn gameplay helps
* Parenting apps
	* Install the babycenter app and register with age details. They give you a 'this week' write up which is unbelievably accurate and tells you exactly what is going on. Sometimes your babies milestones might be a week or two up and down. Just flip to next week or previous week. They also do a very good job of educating you about milestones
* Parenting tech
	* Get a good baby monitor with a dedicated screen if possible. These are hard to find in India. You can use your phone too but I found this much easier
* Handling unsolicited advice
* Baby food - limited info
* Baby vaccination
* Avoid these [[Parenting scams]]
