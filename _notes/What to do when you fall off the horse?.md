- Open up your journal
	- Don't stress out on which format - use laptop, phone, a piece of paper or any note taking app
	- If nothing is available, do it in your head
- Check what all you didn't do
- Think of why you deviated from it
	- Was it because of unexpected events?
	- Did you get bored?
	- Were you too preoccupied or stressed about something else? If so:
		- What do you feel right now?
		- What is triggering those feelings?
		- What will you do about it, or not do?
- Are there any good habits or routines you want to salvage for today?
	- Pick something tiny which you can achieve. A quick walk, exercise bike ride, etc.
	- Use the grounding technique
- Review:
	- Can the trigger be avoided in future?
	- Does the template need to change in some way? Which part is hard or unrealistic?
