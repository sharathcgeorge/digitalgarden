ADHD makes it hard to be consistent. It's like life is one endless marathon, and people with ADHD are excellent sprinters. Occasionally the situation calls for a sprint, a new threat, changing environment, breaking new ground, etc. At that time, the disadvantage becomes an advantage, and I can rise to the occasion.

But at the same time, life as I said is structured as a marathon. The housing loan payments every month, salaries every month, paper bill every month and so on. Life is an endless chain of serial linked commitments, and the sprinters who can't run the marathon struggle. 

How do you solve this? Thinsg can work if you have a series of sprints chained together and headed in the same direction. Project based work, entrepeneurship, all fit the mould. It's structured chaos. You go to work in an emergency room and you have the structure of going to the same place at the same time, but every day can be unique. But this still does not solve the issues in other life stuff.

This is where scaffolding comes handy. You need some kind of system that helps you bridge the gaps with minimal effort.
