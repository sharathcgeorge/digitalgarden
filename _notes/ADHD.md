ADHD stands for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. You might have heard about it, but chances are you misunderstood what it is, just like I did for many years.

First of all, the name is misleading. It is not really an attention deficit, but a difference in how attention is regulated. Some say even this is incorrect and that it is more to do with motivation regulation.

One of my biggest personal learnings through this process is that wanting to do something is different from being motivated to do something. For example, you might want to read a book, or this post but might find it difficult to stick to it. You want to but yoyou u're not motivated to do it at the moment.

Dopamine is the neurotransmitter that makes motivation work in the brain. Without dopamine, you can't do anything, or more accurately, won't do anything. Experiments have shown that mice that are deprived of dopamine will starve to death even when food is right in front of them. They just don't eat. Yes, it was a shockingly cruel experiment but think of the implications. Have there been times when you were so sad or upset that you went hungry even when there was food in front of you?

A shortage of dopamine in your brain can lead to many issues ranging from Parkinson's disease, restless leg syndrome and depression. Issues with dopamine can also cause ADHD.

If you have ADHD, your brain is slightly different from others in how it processes dopamine. It's not that you don't have it, but more that your dopamine supply is slightly erratic. When you're very interested in something, your brain has enough dopamine and works perfectly fine. You can do everything you're supposed to. But when you're not interested in something, find something repetitive or monotonous, you do not have enough dopamine and find it extremely hard to do it. Can you do it? Probably, yes, but at great cost. It becomes difficult to sustain that effort.

Let me explain with some personal examples of both scenarios. This might vary for you.

Lights on - tasks or activities that give me enough dopamine

- Something novel or challenging - solving a completely new problem at work, figuring out how to use an exciting new piece of technology, doing home automation
- Have a lively, friendly debate with someone
- Explore a new place
- Race against a deadline

Lights out or flickering

- Filling up an expense report
- Cleaning my ceiling fans
- Doing laundry, especially folding and putting them away
- Doing the dishes, especially drying and putting them away
- Packing - extremely hard
- Sitting through a lecture and listening
- Being part of a boring conversation
- Waiting in line, without looking at your phone

A few common symptoms:

- Poorly regulated focus
- Hyperactivity
- [[Brain fog]]
