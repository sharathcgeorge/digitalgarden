ADHD makes it hard to be consistent. It's like life is one endless marathon, and people with ADHD are excellent sprinters. Occasionally the situation calls for a sprint, a new threat, changing environment, breaking new ground, etc. At that time, the disadvantage becomes an advantage, and I can rise to the occasion.

But at the same time, you can't get away from the marathon structure of life. The housing loan payments every month, salaries every month, newspaper bill every month and so on. Life is an endless chain of serial linked commitments, and the sprinters who can't run the marathon struggle. 

How do you solve this? Things can work if you have a series of sprints chained together and headed in the same direction. Project based work, entrepeneurship, all fit the mould. You should aim for structured chaos. For example, if you go to work in an emergency room, you have the structure of going to the same place at the same time, but every day can be unique. But this still does not solve the issues in the rest of life.

What can be help is to build scaffolding. In construction, scaffolding is the bare bones structure that supports the whole thing, even before all the gaps are filled in with brick and mortar. Similarily, you can build scaffolding in your life to keep the critical parts supported even when you don't have the focus or attention for it at times.

What this scaffolding looks like can vary but here are a few examples:

- A routine that has become habit and can be carried out easily
	- Brushing your teeth in the morning
	- Puttin on shoes when you walk out the door
	- Checking fuel levels when you get in the car
- A to-do list or task management system and more importantly, a habit or routine for checking them
- Packing lists
- Shopping lists - my favorite now is to add them using Alexa
- Regular work timings
- Work commute
- Changing into work clothes
