Hello there,

My name is Sharath C George and welcome to my digital garden.

I have always hated writing an 'about me' section and in a way this digital garden is my answer to 'who are you?'. But here are a few facts about myself so you know what you're getting into.

I'm 35, live in Bangalore, India, work in digital market research for healthcare companies and have [[ADHD]]. I am also an amateur writer, podcaster, photographer and many other things. I switch hobbies like some people change clothes, which made a lot of sense after my [[ADHD]] diagnosis around 7 months ago.

If you're new to the concept of digital gardens, the idea is to make a corner of the internet that's yours, a second brain with notes that are connected to each other and grows over time into whatever you want it to be. Digital gardens are a counter weight to the current paradigm of blink and you miss it content that keeps getting pushed out on blogs, newsletters and social media.

My digital garden will have everything I curate over time. None of the posts are 'finished' like in a blog. They might be imperfect or tentative, because they are primarily written for me and not for you. But if you find value in it, would love to have you on for the ride.

Some of the topics I'm covering here:

- Hobbies - Writing, Photography, Amateur Radio, Podcasting
- Activism - Hunger relief, waste management, mental health
- [[ADHD]] - Personal journey, management techniques, resources
- Productivity - To-do lists, journaling, routines
- Entrepreneurship
- Parenting
- Life skills
