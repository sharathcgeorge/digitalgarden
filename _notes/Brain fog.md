Different people describe it in different ways. I don't really think of it as fog. I think of it more like running on the beach in the surf. You're trying to run at normal speed but there is a drag on your legs. I don't like the term 'brain fog' because that implies you can't see where you are going. That's not how I experience it. I know what to do just fine, but there is a resistance I feel.

Here are some of the tasks that trigger this for me. I've mentioned some of these on the page [[ADHD]].

- Packing - the worst by far
- Unloading the dishwasher or washed utensils and putting each thing in its right place
- Sorting laundry - folding, separating clothes and putting each one in its place
- Boring conversations - the type where you have zero interest in the topic, but can't fully zone out because its rude or the other person(s) asks questions

The common pattern in all these triggers is that they force you to make small decisions when you're doing something under-stimulating. Loading a dishwasher is kind of OK for me because I can do it on autopilot like when you're driving. You don't have to consciously think about it a lot. Unloading on the other hand forces you to look at each item and figure out where it should go. Same with sorting laundry or a conversation you can't fully disengage from.

Hacks - *These are helpful for mundane tasks and chores, not for more complex ones*

- Stimulant Medication
	- Nothing else comes close. If you're on a stimulant at the time, the wall goes away. But its important to know that you'll find out the wall is gone **only if you push on it**. Over the years, your brain has been conditioned to expect a struggle and you will hate the idea of starting it
- Timers
	- Set a timer for the task and race against it. Something about it kickstarts the brain and makes it easier
	- Works very for chores
	- How to set a timer - phone, smartwatch, visual timers like an hourglass are all options. What I personally use are below:
		- Routinery app on iPhone and Apple Watch for a series of timed tasks
		- Simple iPhone and watch countdown timers. I prefer the watch
		- Amazon echo dot with clock - the clock becomes a count down timer
- Music or podcast in the background
	- Works decently well for chores as your brain gets some stimulation
	- Harder to do if the boring task requires more concentration. If it does, I need to stop or tune out the music which also stops the stimulation
- Exercise
	- Exercise can be great for ADHD in general, but I haven't found it helpful for the brain fog or mental wall you face when doing chores
	- Exercise is helpful to get started on stuff, stay on task, etc. on things that are not absolutely terrible. For example, it helps me concentrate on a report I'm writing at work because I don't intrinsically hate that. But for packing, no big use
- Lists
	- Having a check list helps a lot with chores like packing
	- It externalizes some of the decision making when your brain is desperate to get away from the task at hand
