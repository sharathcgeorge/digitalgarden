The most hardwired instinct in every organism is to reproduce and propagate. Human beings are built to be unusually invested in taking care of their children, given they are born so helpless. That's how evolution wired us. So now you're a parent, and realize this is the single most important job you ever had or will have and want to do anything in your power to see your child survive.

So of course, there will be 20 people waiting to sell you something as soon as you start processing this life changing mission. This is the list of scams, intentional or otherwise that I was exposed to and said no to.

**Stem cell banking** - While you're waiting for your pregnancy scans, a nice lady will smile at you and come over to ask how you are, and if you've thought of securing your child's future by 'banking' cord blood cells.

It's a marketing gold mine - stem cells harvested from the umbilical cord, which we all know is the source of life, and 'banked' for the future. How can you say no, even if it costs Rs. 50,000 - 1,00,000?

Timing is also perfect. There you are in the waiting room, thinking of the future, full of anxiety and hope. How can you say no to something like this?

I did say no. It did not pass the smell test. If this is such an amazing medical intervention, why are we hearing about it from passersby in the waiting room instead of the gynaecologist? If you ask the gynac if it works, it's hard for them to give a clear answer. Is there a remote chance that you will need your own stem cells? Yes, but what is the probability of that compared to the price? If the cost-benefit ratio was favorable, every doctor would recommend it and companies who sell this service would use that channel instead of damn waiting rooms. They basically go to the one stakeholder who is not in a position to make a rational cost-benefit analysis. A parent in that situation will agree to any price they can manage to pay.

The solution we really need is public cord cell banking. Everyone donates cord cells to a public bank just like a blood bank, and people who need it get a match when they need it. More the number of people who donate to it, more the chances of it being usable for everyone. From what I understand, you are more likely to benefit from cord cells from a public bank than your own childhood stem cells which may or may not be usable at the time you need it. But instead, we all pay to these private stem cell bankers, thereby preventing this common good.

**Life insurance/ LIC**

Soon after your child's birth, someone you know, a relative, an uncle at church or someone will approach you and ask you to take an LIC policy for your kid, as it's important to think of the future and save. This is a completely bad deal for multiple reasons listed below:

1. The purpose of insurance is to cover for income loss caused by the untimely death of the insured person. No one is dependant on their newborn child for income and you therefore do not need life insurance
2. Insurance NOT equal to savings - Saving for your kid is great, but an insurance policy is not the way to do that. Start a recurring deposit, mutual fund, or anything else. An insurance policy that promises you money back at the end of the period neither has good returns for what you saved, nor good life insurance coverage.
