One of the symptoms of [[ADHD]] is time blindness. It's quite hard to understand because I doubt I literally can't sense time. I can, but yes, time often gets away from me. I'm chronically late to everything outside of work commitments and it's usually because I feel like there is more time than there is. Or I can be doing something I'm into and have no sense of how much time has passed.

Neurotypical folks will say they have the same problem too and I'm sure they do, but it is as always a question of degree and frequency. This issue or related issues can play havoc with your life. I do not really struggle with this at work and meet my deadlines just fine, but I completely fail at managing it outside of work. This is quite common in the community.

I have realized I have some coping mechanisms I developed unknowingly, but they are all applicable to my work-life. This was probably because the stakes were much higher there and I had to come up with a solution. In personal life, no one is going to stop paying you if you lose your workout habits or do laundry on time. But since I have coping systems in one aspect of life and not in the other, simple solution is to apply one to the other.

Let me start by listing out my coping mechanisms:

- Smart watch with next calendar event on the home screen - 
	- I've had this for several years now. Every time I look at my watch, I also glance at the very obviously visible line right next to it that calls out my next appointment. This keeps me grounded in time, here's the time now and here's the next thing

New coping mechanisms:

- Schedule fulfilling leisure activities with a slight entry barrier or transition barrier
	- For example, I just scheduled time on my calendar at 8 AM on Saturday for a walk. Going for a walk requires me to put on my shoes, comb my hair and go downstairs, which means a transition. ADHD causes issues with transitions too so this does not organically happen. But scheduling time, which is a discipline I'm used to, helps get over that barrier
