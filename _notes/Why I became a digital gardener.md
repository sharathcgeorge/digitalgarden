I have always been an early adopter or most internet publishing services, but never really found a way to make it stick. 

Consistency is the name of the game for all content, as every newsletter and article will tell you. Post 3 tweets a day, 2 blogs a week, 1 newsletter a week and so on. I have tried and failed to do this for years and years, and now I have a reason or excuse for it - [[ADHD]]. 

But this isn't a problem just for people with [[ADHD]], and isnt even a problem for everyone with [[ADHD]]. Some people just don't like this rat race to put out more and more content every day. There was a deep rooted dissatisfaction with the current paradigm which I could never manage to express very well. 

I'm tired of opening Twitter and seeing a stream of trending topics. Every time I see a thread that looks interesting, it ends with 'Did you like this type of content? If you did, sign up for my weekly newsletter'. I have a newsletter too but I find this content race very tiring. And then one day, a fellow [ADHDer](https://twitter.com/arvindhsundar?s=21&t=b5DHLEoo3RzOilKq3zvHuQ) I met online introduced me to the concept of digital gardens, and it seemed to express everything I felt was wrong with the internet now, and gave me a new model for how I can use it.

Within a week of hearing about this concept, I nuked my 'author website', which was supposedly key to building an audience but rarely updated by me. I redirected the domain to this instead.

There are some influential articles on the topic that I will link to at the end, but here's a simple summary:

> Most of the internet is now structured to be a stream of content - tweets, posts, blogs, emails that you can scroll through infinitely, each competing for the 30 seconds of attention you have when you're standing in line or in the loo. Everything is real time, blink or you miss content, unless the algorithm decides you are likely to engage if exposed to it again.

> The idea of a digital garden is to be a counter weight to this, to build a garden, to plant seeds and water them over time as they grow, to have ideas link to each other like pathways in a garden, reinforcing each other, leading to new ones. The garden is built for yourself, and anyone who cares to visit and spend time going down rabbit holes and meandering paths in the woods. An idea might be half formed, but unlike a tweet or a blog post, it is not meant to be a stake in the ground to defend till death because you declared it to the world. You might just update the page tomorrow.

### Characteristics of a digital garden | How it is different from a normal blog or website

- It is primarily written for the creator to learn and document ideas which iterate over time, not for the reader
- They are meant to attract little traffic by design
	- Think of it like your living room. You might have an eclectic collection of souveniers and photos but they are for you, and the occasional visitor who might be interested
- They are meant to be imperfect and in a permanent work in progress state
- They are usually not meant to stay focussed on a niche or a single topic. They grow organically
- Interlinkages are a key characteristic
	- Each note usually links to several others, and shows back links, other notes or pages that mention that note
- Navigation is limited
	- There are few, if any table of contents or categories. You usually just have a few starting points
- Graph view is often a key characteristic
	- You can see each note linked to the others in a graph, and follow along
- They aren't really optimized for SEO or social media posting
	- The point is not to care too much about that 
- They are often called a second brain, an externalization of your thoughts and ideas
- Many digital gardeners are inspired by the [Zettelkasten Method](https://zettelkasten.de/introduction/), which I still haven't read up about in detail

if you want to know more about the digital gardening movement, which is still mostly limited to developers and techies (I'm not one), here are a few articles:
