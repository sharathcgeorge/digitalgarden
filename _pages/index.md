# Hi, I'm Sharath C George ðŸ¥¬ ðŸŒ±

## Welcome to my digital garden ðŸŒ± or my second brain ðŸ§ 

This is not a blog. It is a place for me to write notes about what I learn about the world, myself and the art of creation. A lot of my interests are powered by my ADHD, which is in itself an object of study.

<p style="padding: 3em 1em; background: #f5f7ff; border-radius: 2px;">
These notes are written for me and not you, but I would be happy if you find value in it. Shoot me an email or tweet if you do. These notes are also imperfect and in a permanent work in progress state by design. If you want to find out more about who I am and finished work, click on this [[about me]] page.

### How to navigate my digital gardener

* There is no traditional navigation system. You click on one note and click on linked notes as you see them
* On every page except this homepage, you will see a graph view at the bottom that shows interconnected notes. Click on any node to jump there

#### Here are some good starting points:

- Hobbies - Writing, Photography, Amateur Radio, Podcasting
- Activism - Hunger relief, waste management, freedom of expression
- [[ADHD]] - Personal journey, management techniques, resources
- Productivity - To-do lists, journaling, routines
- Entrepreneurship
- Parenting
- Life skills
